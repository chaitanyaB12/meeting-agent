# AI Notes

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4.1) to help:

- Design project structure
- Write React components
- Create Express routes
- Implement MongoDB models
- Debug React hooks issues
- Improve UI/UX
- Add CRUD operations
- Handle backend status polling

I manually verified:

- All CRUD flows
- Database writes
- LLM extraction correctness
- UI state management
- Error handling
- ESLint issues

The app uses OpenAI API because it provides reliable structured extraction of action items from free-form text.

Final implementation decisions and debugging were done manually.
